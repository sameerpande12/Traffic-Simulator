# Traffic Simulator
Welcome. This is a traffic simulator to simulate behaviour of Indian drivers on roads. 
You can witness various events such as overtaking, accidents, waiting for signals, etc.

## Running the project
The project uses the backend written in prac.cpp to create road matrix, vehicles, signal management etc.
You can initiate the entire project by creating configuration files in which you can specify vehicles, their entry points, their points of entry, time of entry, their sizes, lane changing frequency, signal timings etc.

```make ```
```./exe <configuration-file-name>```
